   ADI Kuiper Linux - A specialized Debian distribution for Analog Devices 
   hardware with pre-configured libraries, tools, and applications for 
   seamless development

Kuiper is a specialized Debian-based Linux distribution designed specifically 
for Analog Devices hardware and evaluation boards. It provides a complete, 
ready-to-use environment with ADI libraries, tools, and applications 
pre-configured for seamless hardware integration.

Whether you're prototyping with an ADI evaluation board, developing embedded 
applications, or building software-defined radio solutions, Kuiper gives you 
a solid foundation to start immediately without the complexity of manual 
system configuration.
